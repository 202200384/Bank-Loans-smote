SMOTE for Bank Loan Classification

This project demonstrates how to handle imbalanced datasets using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) in the context of a bank loan classification problem.

📘 Overview

In real-world banking datasets, the number of approved vs. rejected loans is often imbalanced. This notebook walks through:

Loading and exploring the bank loan dataset

Visualizing class imbalance

Applying SMOTE to balance the dataset

Building classification models (e.g. Logistic Regression, Decision Trees)

Evaluating model performance before and after applying SMOTE


📁 Files

🛠️ Requirements

Install the following libraries (if not already installed):

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn imbalanced-learn

▶️ How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository.


2. Open the notebook using Jupyter:

jupyter notebook smote_for_bank_loans.ipynb


3. Run the cells step-by-step.



📊 Techniques Used

Data Preprocessing

Class Distribution Analysis

SMOTE (Over-sampling minority class)

Train/Test Split

Model Training (Logistic Regression, etc.)

Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix


💡 Purpose

This notebook is useful for:

Learning how to deal with imbalanced datasets

Comparing model performance before and after SMOTE

Understanding how data balancing affects classification results


📌 Notes

SMOTE can help improve recall but may also introduce some noise.

Always evaluate your models using multiple metrics, not just accuracy
